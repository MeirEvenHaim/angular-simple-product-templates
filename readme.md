# Simple Product Program (Angular)

This project is a flexible product management application built using Angular. The model and its properties can be easily modified to fit various use cases. This template serves as a foundation for managing products and streamlines basic Angular setup and configurations.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Model:** Easily change the product model and its properties as needed.
- **Fully Configured Setup:** Ready-to-use Angular template for product management.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built for scalability and customization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12.x or higher)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (v12.x or higher)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the Application
Start the Angular development server:

bash
Copy code
ng serve
The application will be running at http://localhost:4200/ by default.

Customizing the Product Model
Modify the Product Model
The product model can be customized by editing the product.model.ts file. You can add, remove, or modify properties as required.

Example (src/app/models/product.model.ts):

typescript
Copy code
export class Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string; // Add or modify fields here
}
Update the Components
Ensure that any changes to the model are reflected in the components that use it (e.g., product forms, display pages).

Example (src/app/components/product-form/product-form.component.ts):

typescript
Copy code
import { Product } from 'src/app/models/product.model';

product: Product = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Sample Product',
  price: 100,
  description: 'This is a sample product' // Adjust fields as needed
};
Build for Production
To build the project for production:

bash
Copy code
ng build --prod
This will create an optimized build in the dist/ directory, ready for deployment.

Additional Notes
Routing: Ensure you set up routes in app-routing.module.ts if you plan to add additional views or components.
Services: You can manage API calls by editing the product.service.ts file located in the src/app/services folder.
This template is designed to help you get started quickly with Angular while offering flexibility for changes as your project grows.
